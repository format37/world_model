# world_model
Given simple game with field 5x5. Field is a zeros matrix.   
Given one agent. Agent is 1.   
Given native policy for four acions: U, D, L, R.   
We merge field with action column to train neural network, using pytorch.   
And then apply model to predict world state for selected action.
